## NO PLAGIARISM

_This is collaborative enviroment where people can help others code.
This should be used to help others find what mistakes they may have made in their code, so they may correct it_

Peer review is the best way to have **everyone** learn.
### This is NOT to take other people's codes and paste them as your own.
